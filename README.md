# Subaru Solterra

This repository contains signal set configurations for the Subaru Solterra, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Subaru Solterra.

## Generations

The Subaru Solterra represents Subaru's first dedicated battery-electric vehicle:

- **First Generation (2022-present)**: Launched as Subaru's first purpose-built electric vehicle, the Solterra was developed in collaboration with Toyota (which offers its version as the bZ4X). Both vehicles are essentially the same car, manufactured by Toyota on the e-TNGA platform. The Solterra is available exclusively in all-wheel drive configuration, featuring dual motors for a combined output of 214 hp. The Solterra comes equipped with a 71.4 kWh battery pack and features Subaru's EyeSight advanced safety technologies. Note: Since the Solterra and bZ4X share the same platform and systems, this vehicle uses Toyota-based OBD signals rather than traditional Subaru signalsets.
